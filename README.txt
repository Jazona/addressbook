Thank you for taking the time to review this.

I am not experienced in compiling code, so this isn't compiled. Simply take the files and pull them down. You should be able to view everything locally, although you'll get issues around CORS if you aren't using a browser with that functionality turned off or are using a local server like Wamp. 

From this point on the project, I'd probably go further by adding an Undo feature, which I began developing, but ran out of time to keep implementing. All it does is save a copy of the dataset each time it is updated, then clicking "Undo" restores you to the last-saved item in the dataset. This seemed extremely easy given that I have a componentDidUpdate function built in, but I kept running into testing errors and then abandoned it so I could get the rest of the features done.

Other things I'd have liked to add in would have been fun UI tweaks, a more robust function around determining if you are indeed replicating one of your previous additions, support for images, and a quick adjustment to trim long strings in the display by trimming after, oh, maybe 20 characters, and adding an ellipsis ("...").

If this does not meet your satisfaction, I would surely appreciate any feedback you have! I've worked in a single bubble at my current place of employment for going on seven years now and I would be shocked if there weren't plenty of bad habits I've developed.
